# The Audre Lorde Questionnaire To Oneself

## The Background 
[The Audre Lorde Questionnaire to Oneself](https://divyavictor.com/the-audre-lorde-questionnaire-to-oneself/) was adapted from “[The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action”](https://electricliterature.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/silenceintoaction.pdf), collected in The Cancer Journals. This resource was created by [Divya Victor](https://divyavictor.com) for students of her Creative Writing courses at Nanyang Technological University in January 2016.

## The Coding Project 
### [https://lorde-questionnaire.seedaschool.com/](https://lorde-questionnaire.seedaschool.com/)
The Audre Lorde Questionnaire to Oneself is also a coding project built by [Seeda School](https://www.seedaschool.com). This project is used as a teaching tool built in tandem with the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) curriculum. On top of building the [Survery Form](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/) certification project, I invite students to build their version of the Audre Lorde Questionnaire to Oneself in order to practice and play with their HTML and CSS skills.

The project leverages most of the HTML and CSS skills covered in the Responsive Web Design freeCodeCamp curriculum up to the Survery Form certification project. Functionality and features implemented in this project that are not covered inside the freeCodeCamp curriculum are the pill button styling, use of a custom font, and collecting responses with Google forms.
